    "text": "In ancient Roman religion and myth, Janus is the god of beginnings and gates. He has a double nature and is usually depicted as having two faces, since he looks to the future and to the past. Janus presided over the beginning and ending of conflict, and hence war and peace. The doors of his temple were open in times of war and closed during peacetime. As the god of gates, he was also associated with entering and exiting the doors of homes. Janus frequently symbolized change and transitions, such as the progress from one condition to another, from one vision to another, and the growth of young people into adulthood. Hence, Janus was worshipped at the beginning of the harvest and planting times, as well as at marriages, deaths, and other beginnings. Janus had no specialized priest assigned to him, but the high priest himself carried out his ceremonies. Janus represented the middle ground between barbarism and civilization, rural and urban space, youth and adulthood. The ancient Greeks had no equivalent to Janus, whom the Romans claimed as distinctively their own.",
